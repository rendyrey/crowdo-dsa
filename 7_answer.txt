Issue:
1. Ambiguous on created_at since articles & comments may have this column. Need the column prefix
Example:
articles.created_at & comments.created_at

2. There's SQL injection risk because #{params[:date]} is interpolates into SQL
using '?' symbol.
Example:
.where("publish_date >= ?", params[:date])

This will not return Ambiguous column if it's not fixed yet.
